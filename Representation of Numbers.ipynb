    "The function dec_2_bin(d), where d is a positive integer in decimal, returns b - the binary representation of d. The output is a list of 1s and 0s, and the leading term is always a 1 unless the decimal input value is 0. \"dec_2_bin\" first checks if the input value d is 0. If d is 0, then b returns a list comprised of a single zero. Otherwise, we iterate from d to 1 as follows: add item value modulo 2 to list, then floor divide iterated value until 1 or 0 is reached. Lastly, since we start at d and iterate toward 1, we reverse the list and then return it.  "

    "Note: the above function ieee_to_dec appears to work for the first test value, but in the second case the value does not output as expected. This is suspected to be a result of error in the computation, specifically with the method that was implemented to compute the expected output, as this output was anticipated to be a rational number (i.e., a number with a fractional part). Additionally, it appears that the primary source of error in the second case is a consequence of the amount of total interations preformed. Ultimately, this entails that there is more error being produced as the loop continues through all values of the input string during the last step, where we attempt to obtain the mantissa for our final computation.
